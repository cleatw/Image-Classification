# IMAGE CLASSIFICATION ON PRODUCE

ALL DATA SOURCED FROM: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits

## STAKEHOLDER AND BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING 


## DATA  &  DATA ANALYSIS
I utilized data sourced from the Fruits 360 datset on Kaggle (linked above). This contained over 65,000 images of fruits and vegetables in 131 different classes for identification. Because the data was pre split, I decided to use Keras' own preprocessing techniques to do a split of my own on their training folder. 
## MODELING
For all of my models included I used the 'Sequential' model from Keras. This allowed me to create and weave custom layers into my own Convoluted Neural Network to train my images with.
